Welcome to the fourth insallment of Elixir Quiz. This week, we embark on our first multi-week project, building a game of 5 card stud poker. This week we will be building the deck of cards.

### An introduction to 5 card stud

5 card stud is a card game in which players play against each other.

At the start of the game, each player is dealt 5 cards face down. After assessing their initial hands, players take turns discarding any of their cards and receiving replacements for them.

Players then compare their hands against one another to determine the winning hand.

For our first step, we will build ourselves a deck of cards.

If you haven't explored testing with ExUnit yet, the poker project provides a great opportunity to start.

### The problem

> Create a module that will allow us to create a shuffled deck of cards. How the cards and deck are represented are completely up to you.

> Since we're working with the cards this week, also ensure that you have a function to compare the value of 2 individual cards.

### How do I enter?

The Poker part 1 quiz runs from Saturday August 30th 2014 until Friday September 5th, 2014.

To enter, just complete the problem and post the code to [our subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz). I'd suggest this week storing your project in a source control system, as we'll be working on this for a few weeks.

[GitHub](https://github.com) can be useful for hosting your solutions, but anywhere is fine.

### Example solutions

After the quiz period ends on September 5th, I will update this section and talk about some interesting solutions that were posted to [our subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz)
