title: FizzBuzz
---

Welcome to the first ever Elixir Quiz problem. This week we will be tackling the classic interview question, FizzBuzz.

## About FizzBuzz

## The problem

The FizzBuzz problem is fairly straight forward.

Print the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with the word "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with the word "Buzz". For numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5, replace the number with the word "FizzBuzz".

So for example, 1 to 15 would look like:

1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz

## How do I enter?

To enter, just complete the problem and post the code to [our subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz). For short solutions, you can put the code directly into your comment in the quiz thread.

For larger solutions, please host your code elsewhere and link to it.

[GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com) can be useful for hosting your solutions, but anywhere is fine.

## Example solutions

After the quiz period ends on 17-08-2014, I will update this section and talk about some interesting solutions that were posted to [our subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz)
