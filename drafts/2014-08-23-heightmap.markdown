title: Heightmap
description: A programming challenge in which we generate a random terrain that could potentially be used in a game.
---

Welcome to the third installment of Elixir Quiz. This week we will be creating heightmaps whih could potentially be used in games or 3D rendering.

### About Heightmaps



### The problem

> Write a program that takes a single number (A) as input, and produces a randomly generated heightmap in an AxA grid. Output can take any form, such as ascii or a bitmap.

The choice of algorithm is up to you. Some algorithms that are commonly used are A and B

### Example Output

Here is some example output for a 32x32 ascii grid

And another for a 256x256 coloured bitmap

### How do I enter?

The Heightmap quiz runs from Saturday August 23rd 2014 until Friday August 30th, 2014.

To enter, just complete the problem and post the code to [our subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz). For short solutions, you can put the code directly into your comment in the quiz thread.

For larger solutions, please host your code elsewhere and link to it.

[GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com) can be useful for hosting your solutions, but anywhere is fine.

### Example solutions

After the quiz period ends on August 30th, I will update this section and talk about some interesting solutions that were posted to [our subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz)
